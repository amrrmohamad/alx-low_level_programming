# Introduction to C Programming - A Low-Level Language

Welcome to the **Introduction to C Programming** repository! This project aims to introduce the core concepts of C, a powerful low-level programming language that provides fine-grained control over system resources. This repository is ideal for those looking to understand the foundations of systems programming, memory management, and performance optimization.

## 🧑‍💻 Overview

C is widely regarded as one of the most efficient and fast programming languages. It forms the backbone of many modern operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems. By using C, developers gain a deep understanding of how computers work at the hardware level, with control over memory allocation, system calls, and hardware interactions.

This repository provides an introduction to C for those seeking to learn or refine their skills in low-level programming. Topics covered range from basic syntax to pointers and memory management.

## ✨ Features

This repository includes detailed examples of:

- **Basic Syntax**: Introduction to C syntax, structure of a C program, and common data types.
- **Variables and Operators**: How to define variables, and use operators like arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.
- **Control Flow**: Implementing decision-making with `if`, `else`, and loops such as `for` and `while`.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions, passing parameters, and understanding scope and storage classes.
- **Pointers and Memory Management**: An introduction to pointers, dynamic memory allocation with `malloc`, `free`, and understanding memory addresses.
- **Arrays and Strings**: Handling arrays, multidimensional arrays, and string manipulation in C.
- **Structures**: Working with user-defined data types like `struct` and `union`.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files using file pointers, working with text and binary files.
- **Preprocessor Directives**: Understanding macros, `#define`, and conditional compilation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need a C compiler installed on your machine. Popular options include:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: Available for Linux, macOS, and Windows (via MinGW).
- **Clang**: Available for macOS and Linux.
- **Microsoft Visual Studio**: A full-featured IDE for C/C++ programming on Windows.

To verify if GCC is installed, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gcc --version
```
